      <p> Ooh, it's the super secret plans for the future. These are ideas that I want to do but knowing myself, I know I can't do it on my own. I'm listing them here so if anybody is interested and wants to co-host with me, please let me know! I really want these ideas to come to life because I think they'll be really fun and interesting, but I learned from past projects that it's extremely hard to be the sole owner doing directing, producing, and everything in between. So please let me know if you want to do it with me!</p>

        <h2> SAE Entertainment </h2>
        <p> It's a title in process and honestly SAE is just a placeholder that definitely needs to be re-named, but this is my idea for a lore driven idol group. The story follows the American based idol group as they go from rookie to idol. The twist? There's a murder mystery aspect to it. Idols and trainees keep on getting into freak accidents and dying, and the main characters are quite worried. </p>
        <h3> At a glance </h3>
        <p> TW: Death. Characters are killed, and much of the supporting cast are dead idols. And because the conflict involves the death of trainees, this means teens are killed.</p>
        <p> Premise: </p>
        <p> Idols and trainees of SA Entertainment (SAE) have been dying since the company started gaining traction. The newest idols of the company, *E, get visited by a strange, supernatural phenomenon that grants them the ability to do something and save their peers from premature deaths. (They get supernatural powers.) </p>
        <p> An entirely English idol/cover group involving singing (on the part of the idols) and voice acting. The storyline and voice acting is equally important, if not more. Realistically speaking, we will start as a cover group, but they don’t have to be originally English songs, we can translyric them. And even though the idols canonically have roles like “main dancer” or “lead vocalist” line divisions will be equal. </p>
        <p> This is set in modern day America where supernatural powers are not normal.</p>
        <h3> Additional Information </h3>
        <p> Since all of the stuff is already written in a different document, I'll just link that here. I had gone as far as to write audition lines as well as a timeline for the publication of videos. </p>
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RZA9jpjjGkq-UGE8ApvpvmetKFbMnuPrm1eXB7C66kU/edit?usp=sharing"> More info here </a>
        <h3> What's holding me back? </h3>
        <ol>
          <li> I worry that this is too heavy for an idol group. Idol groups tend to be very light hearted and cheery, the dark nature of this concept might be too dark for an idol group. </li>
          <li> Because it's such a big project, I would need at least one co-leader. Having someone to help with the logistics would allow me to focus on developing the story so the plot can keep moving. </li>
          <li> Aesthetics. These are all original characters and because they have a story, how are we going to show that story? Making a comic or an animation would be a lot of work, so where's a medium that isn't a podcast? </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2> Stayracha </h2>
        <p> A permanent cover group or a rotating set of coverists who do english covers of Stray Kids songs. It'll be a mix of B-Sides and title tracks, as well as a mix between new songs and older songs.</p>
        <h3> What's holding me back?</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> Lyricist. Stray Kids is notorious for having very strong raps, and I don't think I have enough rapping skill to do it justice.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2> Glances and Chances </h2>
        <p> A story created using original MMD animation, the idea was it would become an animated webseries. I was the director, producer, animator, character designer, and writer. It all became too much and after one episode the series was dropped. </p>
