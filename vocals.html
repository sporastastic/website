Their fate lies in the hands of their mother, Gaea, who by the way, promises the children a chance to start over if they carry out a somewhat simple task for her. Becoming idols. They are to gather a large amount of attention from the mortals on earth and only then will they return to their rightful place as the Gods and Goddesses of Mt. Olympus.</p>
