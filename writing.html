        <h2> Ariadne </h2>
        <h3> Background </h3>
        <p> <b>Created for Ever After Chorus Battle.</b> When the ban started and governments were starting to capture people, she and her best friend were quickly captured. They were only 7 at the time, and could barely do anything, let alone have the ability to conceal their powers. So when the government came, they were able to capture Ariadne first, and she was told not to move, or else they’d kill her. Being the naive child that she was, she listened, fearing for her life. Her best friend, on the other hand, was more rebellious and fought against their captors. Her best friend died fighting, while Ariadne watched from a few feet away. After her best friend died though, she resolved to never be a bystander ever again. She will always take action, even if in hindsight not taking action would be better. </p>
        <h3> Personality </h3>
        <p> Loud, lively, quirky, and brash. Calm, quiet, and collected are not words that describe Ariadne. She’s always ready to go on an adventure and have new experiences. She may not look like it, but she will fight anyone. Anyone. Because of how often she gets in fights, she’s often bruised up, but she doesn’t let that stop her from doing anything.</p>

        <p> A part of Ever After Chorus Battle was that there was a story based portion, where teams had to write stories of their original characters and what universe they were in. I was the main author, but <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2NGbYXiVxpt8oMY9LTxEmQ">Maika</a> and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqYKdlWBmLyvWm49uoxDiTw">Tari</a> helped write as well. </p>
